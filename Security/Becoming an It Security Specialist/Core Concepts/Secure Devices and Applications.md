### [[Mobile and Wireless Security]]

## Keeping data private
- Provide confidentiality and integrity on individual files and folders by using encryption
- On a system you may have documents and files you need to protect from being accessed by unauthorized individuals
- Encryption
	- Ensures Confidentiality
	- Ensures Integrity
- We can set custom permission for files and folders or more protection
- On windows we can use EFS or BitLocker
- EFS
	- Simple and secure
	- Just right click a folder and in properties just go to advanced and enable encrypt content
	- Small business or home users
- BitLocker
	- Is encryption for volumes and drives
	- Is for windows Pro or Enterprise
	- For enterprise networks
- TPM
	- Used for saving encrypting keys    
## Understanding cryptography
- Use encryption and hashing
	- Hashing ensures the integrity
- Two types of encryption
	- Symmetric
		- Single shared secret key
		- DES
		- AES
	- Asymmetric or Public Key
		- Uses to keys, one public and one private
		- Used with PGP (pretty good privacy)  
		- Like RSA
- Hashing
	- Takes a variable lenght input and outputs a fixed lenght value
	- MD5
	- SHA
