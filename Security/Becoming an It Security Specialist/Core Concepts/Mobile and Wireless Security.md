### [[Investigating Internet Security]]

## Securing your Wi-Fi
- Wireless networks
	- 802.11
		- Is the protocol used to connect wireless devices
	- An access point has an BSSID
		- Is the MAC address of the access point
	- Every BSS(Basic Service set) has a BSSID
	-  An insecure home router allow others to spy on you
		-  Change the default password
		-  Don't use UPnP
	- Configure the access point 
		- Change the default password
		- Cause the default password are per model of access point
		- Update the firmware
		- Disable Plug and Play
		- Disable remote access through a browser
		- Enable encryption using WPA
		- Change encryption keys periodically  
- Pre-Shared key
	-  Is one key that is shared between authorized entities
	-  Encryption scrambles data by using a key 
- The same key is shared by different entitites
	- But the important thing is that the entities keep the secret key, well secret
- Use encryption to protect the router
	- WEP  Wired equivalent privace
	- WPA/WPA2 Wi-Fi protected access 
### Conceal your access point
- You can lock down your wifi by disabling SSID broadcast
- Use MAC addressing filtering
	- To allow only the registered MAC addresses to join the network
### Protecting mobile devices
- Mobile devices have the same risks as a laptop
- But the more important one is the man in the middle attack
- Like a Wi-fi pineapple 
- You need to keep your software updated
- Use passphrase or password
- Use biometrics
- Set an idle timeout
- Use Good Web sense
- Don't download everything you see
- Disable geotagging
- Don't respond to numbers that you don't know
