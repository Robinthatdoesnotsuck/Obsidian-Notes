### [[Core Security Principles]]

## Viruses and Worms
Viruses can self replicate, but need ways to propagate
Worms can spread on their own
### Viruses

- A virus needs a host but need a way of traveling
- Spread
	- From email
	- Removable media
	- Files or apps on the internet
### Worms
- Can spread without any help
- Spread and replicate
- Consumes resources of a computer
### Phases of an Attack
- Probe
	- The malware identifies werak targest
- Penetrate
	- The malware transfers its malicious code to the target
- Persist
	- The malware attempts to persist in the system its attacking
- Propagate
	- The malware attempts to propagate the attack to other systems
- Paralyze
	- The malware was able to cause damage to the system
- Todays malware are insane
	- Have rootkit
	- Are viruses/worms/trojans
### Defend
Be almost paranoid, Use your own malware protection, don't download stuff

## Eliminating unwanted surveillance
### Spyware
- Is a type of malware that tracks information and records activity and sends the information to somebody
- Trackware is Spyware that tracks the habits of the person in the internet
- It is not illegal but it is an unwanted program
## Holding data hostage
### Ransomware
- A type of malware that holds a system hostage
- It is used to keep data hostage
- It spreads like other types of malware
- Has become more popular cause it is profitable
- Can block you from your system, encrypt your data or stop apps
### Phases of Encrypting Ransomware
- Phase 1
	- Attacker sends a legitimate looking phishing email
	- The user opens the emails ang gets the ransomware
- Phase 2
	- Attempst to execute and spawn child processes
	- Encrypt files and then communicates with C & C (command and control server)
	- Send encryption key and awaits further instructions
- Command and controll server sends a ransom message 
### Protection
- Think before you click
- String spam filters
- Anti malware protection
- Backups of the files in remote locations
