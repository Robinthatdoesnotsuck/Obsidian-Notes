- Used for monitoring users and getting sensitive information
- With this a hacker can drill into the deeper network
- It is not a virus, a rootkit can avoid detection
- Rootkit are hard to detect and difficult to remove
## Overflowing the buffer
- Is a software vulnerability that happens when a process or progarm puts more data into the buffer than it can hold.
- A hacker can use this to install malware, spyware or a rootkit
- Buffers are areas in memoery that are created to hold a finite amount of data
- This extra information can go somewhere overflow and overwrite other buffers
- This is used so that the hacker can access important or restricted programs buffers
- This can give the hacker access to critical shit
- Hackers love buffer overflows
### Protection
- Don't program like an ass
- Specialized software that monitors the buffers
## Exploiting the unknown
### Zero-Day Attack
Takes advantage of a software vulnerability that is unkown or undisclosed by the software vendor.
An attack that is exploited before the vendor knows about this vulnerability
- Antimalware protection
- Anomaly or Profile-Based detection
	- Detects new and previously attacks
- Malware signatures are used to detect malware
- Cannot detect unknown attacks
- Some attacks can slip from antimalware
