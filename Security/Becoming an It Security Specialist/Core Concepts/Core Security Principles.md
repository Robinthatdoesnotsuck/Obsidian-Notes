## A Basic principle of providing a secure System is to manage risk and protect sensitive information
### What we want is to keep *data private*, *unchanged* and *available*
### Or what is known as the *CIA* triad
### Confidentiality
Is the promise of keeping private information well private, by preventing unauthorized access
### Integrity
Data integrity can be compromised when  information has been altered or destroyed, either maliciously or accidentally
#### Examples
- Modifying records on a grade card by accident
### Availability
Is ensuring Data  and services are available only to the ones authorized to access them
#### Examples
- DDOS Atacks
### Access
Making sure everyone who access the data verify their identity in some way.
Making some access control to digital data by assigning permissions.
Using encryption to see data only if you have a key
### Integrity violations
Business use specialized software to monitor for unusual activity and backups of their systems 
### Private Information
Includes personally identifiable information, like credit card, social security number, bank account. Business data like employee records or trade secrets

## Managing risk
### Risk
When something is open or exposed to harm, which can result in something negative.
Organizations use risk analysis well to see if they have potentia threats, Along with evaluating system weaknesses.
The goal is to reduce risk to their assets.
Risk equals threats times vulnerabilities.
### Threats
A threat is anything that can exploit a vulnerability.
A threat is something that might happen.
We use threat assesment to determine how to approach them.
### Vulnerability
A vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited.
Like unpatched systems, software laws.
Most vulnerabilities can be fixed, so we can test and adress our vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis.
### Tangible and intangible assets
Tangible
- Is hardware
Intangible
- Software
## Avoiding Scam artist
### Social Engineering
Is when cybercriminals use methods to tricks us into doing something to get information about a system or organization
It is acomplish via telephone, persuasion, dumpster diving, online.
It is one of the hardest attacks to protect against and now is one of the most common attacks used in the world
The reason social engineering is so rampant its because it doesn't require anyh technical skills to get into a system.
Other Method
-	Phising using email
-	Vishing using the phone
-	Can use Instant messaging
### Best Practices
Be aware
Don' trust people
## Atack surfaces
Known or potentail vulnerabilites.
Like Software, networks, users and people.
A cyberattack is anything that can compromise the security of a system.
- Software
	- The largest attack surfaces
	- Types
		- Apps
		- Browsers
		- Mobile apps
		- Everything in the background of the applications
	- Vulnerabilites
		-  The OS is running
		-  Glitches or flaws
	- Attack
		-  Minor annoyance
		-  Or system crash
- Hardware
	- Stealing something or cutting something
	-  Needed physical access to the device
- Network
	- Exposure to bogus networks
	- Looks normal
	- Capture information
	- Access to a home network
- Users
	- The weakest link
	- Lack of education
	- Security education training and awareness
	- Report unusual activity
	- Delete phishing emails  
- IoT
	- Collection of devices that are connected to the internet
	- This is another attack surface that is getting bigger
### Cyber Attacks
#### Passive
- Noninvasive - spoofing
- Capturing passwords or data files
#### Active
- Tries to break into a secured system by force
- Steal, modify information or introduce malicious code
## Threat Modeling
Identifies possible weaknesses along with ways cybercriminals can use the information, across entry points such as software, hardware, network, and users.
It is becoming more important cause we've got more threats.
- Ransomware - holding data hostage
- Supply chain attacks - penetration through a third-party vendor
- Form Jacking - stealing informations using banking and eCommerce sites forms
- Crypto jacking - mining crypto with your system
- **Vulnerability analysis** - Analyzing potential weaknesses for access vectors
- **Threat assesment** - determine the best approach to securing a system against a threat
- **Threat modeling** - looks at the external attack vectors and how the attacks are delivered
### Threat modeling methods
Are used to create a visualization of an entire system along with the potential entry points and possible attacks.
Gain a well rounded view of potential threats to reduce risks.
Helps visualize vulnerabilites, to prevent an attack that may result in a loss of an asset
