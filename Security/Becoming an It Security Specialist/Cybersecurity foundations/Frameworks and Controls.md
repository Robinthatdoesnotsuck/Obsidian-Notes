### Rainbow Series of books for USA department of defense
- #### Orange Book: Computers
- #### Red Book: Networks
- #### Green Book: Passwords
- Many more
### Orange Book
- Describes the security design of a computer that can be trusted to handle both unclassified and classified information
- It proves the paradigm of information security
- Provides technical cirteria for the security design and security evaluation of the hardware, firmware and application software of the computer
- It introduces four key concepts in information security
	- A reference monitor
		- That mediates access to system resources
	- A formal security model 
		- for reading and writing information 
	- A trusted computing base
		-  as a subsystem containing all the security code
	- The testing
		- Required to achieve various levels of assurance
- #### Reference Monitor
	-  Is an essential element of any system that provides multilevel secure computing facilities and controls
	-  Enforces access controls between people and things in the system
		-  A subject can be people or a program module
		-  An object can be a data file or a system function
	- Three essential characteristics
		- Reference validation mechanism must be tamper proof
		- The reference mechanism must always be invoked
		- Must be small enough to be conpletely analyzed and tested
- #### The Bell-LaPadula scheme
	- For managing multilevel information flows
	- Two approaches of security
		- Discretionary access control **DAC**
			- Is applied security within the same classification of information to provide a means of restricting information access on a need-to-know basis
			- Requires an access control list to be maintained by an administrator   				
			- It is access control list like IAM
		- Mandatory access control **MAC**
			- A user holds certain level of acess rights or clearand and an object is labeled at a certain level of sensitivity
			- Levels of sensitivity
				- Restricted
				- Confidential
				- Secret
				- Top-Secret
			- Two Rules
				- Simple security rule: Users at a certain level can't read anything which has a label at a higher sensitivity level
				- Star security rule: A user at a certain clearance level cannot write down to a file which is labeled at a lower level as this may expose sensitive information to users that don't have that clearance level   
- #### Trusted computer system TCB
	- It is a trusted computing base that contains all of the elements of the system responsible for supporting the security policy and supporting the isolation of objects on which the protection is based
	- Bounds or security perimeter
		-  Includes hardware firmware and software critical to protection
	- It must be designed and implemented so that nothing outside the TCB is sensitive or relevant on the management of security
	- Should be simple and consistent with the functions it has to perform
- #### Classifiaction scheme
	- Is a scheme for evaluationg assurance of systems
	- Four leves of assurance
		- D1: Minimal protection
		- C1 to C2: Discretionary Protection
		- B1 to B3: Mandatory Protection
		- A1: Verified protection   
## The Nist Cybersecurity Framework
- Made by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology in 2014
- Is the defacto standard for cybersecurity
- Is an action-oriented approach to security and consists of three elements
	- The Framewrok Core
	- Framework Profile
	- Framework Implementation
- ### Framework Core
	- Provides a set of activities to achieve cybersecurity
	- Described by the five areas
		- Identify
		- Protect
		- Detect
		- Respond
		- Recover
		- Each of these activities is decomposed in a total of 23 categories of security activities  
- The framework itself doesn't provide a set of controls
## Adopting the NIST Framework
- ### Framework Profile
	- Used to align business outcomes and cybersecurity activities
	- Provides a view of risks and a development plant to brach the two
- ### Maturity model or implementation tier
	- #### The basic level of cybersecurity and maturity is the partial implementation tier
		- Is is characterized by it's prize risk management being reactive, where cybersecurity activities aren't based on risk objectives or business outcomes
	- #### The next tier is where there is little external collaboration
		- Risk management practices are formalized but may not be adapted across the organization
		- There is informal sharing of cybersecurity information internally only
	-  #### The next tier of maturity is repeatable
		-  Where a risk is management is formalized and mandated as a policy
		-  Processes exist to respond to changes in risk
		-  Collaboration is external and internall
	- #### Highest maturity level Adaptive
		- It extends the third level with awareness and agility
		- Applies continuous changes to security activities
- ### Nist recommendation
	- When adopting a cybersecuirt framework NIST recommends the adoption of two profiles
		- First
			- Should represent the current state of cybersecurity as assessed against the subset of enterprise activities thar are required
		- Second
			- The target state of cyber security
			- Set as the acceptable level of risk against each of the enterprise activiteis
	- A security plan of proritized projects can be defined to close the gap the current state and the target one
	- For organizations that are starting to integrate a security framework there are key actions to have in mind
		- Identify Key business outcomes
			- Understand threats and risks
			- Create a profile for it
			- Conduct risk assesment
			- Decide the target profile
			- Create an action plan
			- Establish and extecute a program for the plan   
## Basics of cyber risk
-	Cybersecurity is at its heart, the management of digital risk
-	Like hackers or malware
-	A standard approach has been developed by the national institute of standards in technogloy
	- Special publication 800-30
	- Guide for conducting Risk assesments
- The ISO also provides guidance with its ISO 27005 Information Security Risk Management publication
- ![[Core Security Principles#Risk]]
- Risk Starts with a threat event
	- That must be analyzed to determined its probability of ocurring
	- Considering the actiors, capabilities and resources
	- Consider the intent or motivation 
- The losses could be financial, intelligence, disruption or just recognition
- Then is to set the vulnerabilities in our information and processing assets like
	- Databases
	- networks
	- WorkStations
	- Servers
	- The risks can be anything that affects the functionality of any of these devices
- Then we consider the impact on the business in case of one of these events
	- We carry out business impact assesments  	
## Cyber Threats and controls
- ### Source threat intelligence
	- A catalog of threats can be found at the Appendix E to the NIST Special Publication SP 800-30
	- This catalogs gives us events expressed as Tactics, Techniques and Procedures or TTPs.
	- Another source is the MITRE ATT&CK Site that is used in the MITRE cybersecurity resilency framework
	- Antoher one is Veris, that is an open database
	- ThreatStream offers an open source cyber intelligence blog that talks about the current activities and threat actors
	- There are also the reports of the threat actors, techniques and target vulnerabilities
- ### So once we identify the risk we have four possible treatments
	- #### Risk Acceptance 
		- Is when the risk is withing the business appetite
	- #### Risk avoidance
		- When it is better to stop doing that line of business than take the risk
	- #### Risk transfer
		- Where a third party takes the risk
	- #### Risk mitigation
		- Where we actually implement controls to reduce the risk
		- ##### Four key types of control that can be applied    
			- It is generally recommended that two or more are used together to achieve a good defense
			- ##### Deterrent controls
				- Reduces the threat
			- ##### Preventive Controls 
				- Stop an attack from succeeding by not allowing it to get an asset to exploit us
			- ##### Detective controls
				- Detect an attak that has taken place
			- ##### Corrective controls
				- Reduce the impact of an incident
				- They are the response to recover functional controls
## Recording, reporting and the risk context
- We need to have a report of all the risks available in our organization
- This is usually done using what are known as governance risk and controls or GRC tools
- The risk register contains the basic risk information, like ID and name, classification of the information and the risk owner and a small summary of the consequences
	- ### Risk information is presented in two ways
		- Inherent risk assuming no controls are in place
			- This determines how strong the controls need to be
		- The control details are provided and a residual risk is calculated to show the current risk that's being experienced by the business
	- Risk register is a key feature of the cyber-risk program
		- Risks can be shown in a risk heat-map
		- Or a risk bubble char
	![[Pasted image 20210930135807.png]]
		- A typical approach to managing risks is to accept any very low risks which appear in the green area
		- Low risk in the gold area are also accepted but they are monitored
		- Medium risks in the yellow area are scheduled for routine remediation work
		- High risk require immediate remediation work
		- Sometimes the bubble chart is enhance to show the planned progress of mitigations using an arrow and antoher bubble to identify the final expected risk level
		![[Pasted image 20210930135940.png]]
		- This charts provide a powerful tool to show the work done to reduce a risk
	- Risk context
		- Is the risk bubble chart and the tables used to determine likelihood and impact
	 ![[Pasted image 20210930140020.png]]
		- These tables are specifically developed for the business by its risk officer
		- It should also contain the guidance on the actions required to be taken at each risk level
