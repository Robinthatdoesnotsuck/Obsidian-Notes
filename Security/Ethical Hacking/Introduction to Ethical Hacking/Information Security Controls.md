## Defense in depth
- Attacking a network is easier than it seems
	- Taking advantage of configuration managements
	- Can occurrs from ouside or inside
	- Defense must be a layered approach
- ### Three basic elements
	- Technical Controls
		- Should detect threats and protect the infrastructure
		- The goal is to make an attack cumbersone
		- It should provide a centralized correlation of events in order to notify someone in charge in case of  suspicion
		- Applications need to be tuned to provide early notifications of potential attacks and determine the possible source and target
	- Administrive controls and procedures
	- The people 
	- The network administrator has a number of technical controls that add to the security layers
	- #### Firewall
		- Is a hardawre or software-based method that controls incoming and outgoing traffic
		- It is a set of rules that either permit or deny traffic on a networ or host
		- Firewalls should be used in every network
	- #### Unified threat management
		- Next-generation firewalls
		- Provide firewall intrusion prevention
		- Antivirus support
		- Data loss prevention
		- Content filtering
		- Protect the network while reducing complexity
	- Other ways to defend the network
		- Spam filters
		- Intrusion detection system
		- Packet shapers
		- Honeypots
		- Network isolation
			- VLANS
			- Network address translation NAT
			- Encryption
		- Access controls also are in place to ensure authorized
