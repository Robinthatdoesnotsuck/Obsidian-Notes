## [[Core Security Principles]]
### Security analyst
- Is in charge of providing services to ensure confidentiality, integrity and availability
- Standard regulations
	- PCI DSS
	- HIPAA
	- SOX
	- GDPR
	- These standards define security measures to prevent data loss
- Guidelines
	- COBIT Framework  
## Threat landscape 
- ### Malware
	- Network-based ransomware
	- Whiper malware
	- Polymorphic
- Today almost every traffic is encrypted but it has its flaws
	- Malicious actors can conceal themselves with this
	- Moving thorugh your network in the form of an advanced persistent threat
- ### Phishing
	- Spear phising
		- Attacks that prey on the fears like current events and problems
- ### IOT
	- It is an expanding vector of attack  
	- Many IOT devices are untested and with many vulnerabilitites
	- Burst attack is like DDOS
		- But for IOT

## Attack vectors 
- A method by which someone gains unlawful entry into a system
- The goal is to deliver malicious payload or other malicious act 
- Like social engineering with email
	- ![[Core Security Principles#Social Engineering]]
- But we also need to defend ourselves from malware
	- ![[Understanding Malware#Protection]]
## Attack types 
- The goal of cybersecurity is to 
	- Create
	- Implement
	- Monitor
	- Assess
	- Maintain
	- Continously improve
- Different type of attacks
	- Physical
	- Social engineering
	- Brute force
- An attack can result in the loss of some form of asset  
- Active Attacks
	- DDOS
	- Dictionary attack
	- Brute force attack
	- Many attacks are the consequence of social engineering
- Passive Attacks
	- SIP flood
		- Session initiation protocol
		- Used to set up and maintain end user session for communication protocols
		- Malware

## The Cyber Kill Chain 
- An advanced persistent threat is when a malicious actor gains access to a network, and remains undetected for weeks, months and even years.
- ### The Cyber Kill Chain
	- If we identify threats early enough we will reduce the possibility of an advanced persistent threat
	- Advanced
		- Means it is targeted
		- Coordinated
		- Wel thought out actions
		- Purposeful
	- Persistent
		- The activity is in our system long time 
	- Threat
		- Anything that has a motive, means or the ability to alter a system's integrity 
- ### Seven steps of the CyberKill Chain
 ![[Pasted image 20211001165813.png]]
	- #### Reconnaissance
		- Gathering information
		- The actor researches security vulnerabilities on the system
			- What type of data do we store?
			- Where is located?
			- Who can access it?
			- What can i gather?
	- #### Weaponization
		- The actors can device a plan to get inside the network
		- Malware
	- #### Delivery
		- The actor now crafts a plan to deliver the attack
		- Using phising
	- #### Exploitation
		- Now that they are in the network they can exploit a vulnerability
		- Exploit errors in the system
	- #### Installation    
		- The malware is installed
	- #### Command and control
		- Gains access to the system
		- The control server will issue commands to the malware installed
	- #### Actions on the objective
		- This is when the actor will achieve its goal
