## Drawbacks
- Patterns cost
- Implementing a design pattern is not free
- They are not the fastest way to develop software
- Technical debt
- Don't save a little now to spend a lot later
## Overview of the creational patterns for C#
- These patterns focus on the lifetime and creation of objects
- ### Factory Method
	- Separate using an object form creating it
	- Use dynamic context to decide what to build
- ### Abstract Factory
	-  The interface for a factory so that the correct factory can be provided for in a dynamic situation
	-  Create a family of related dependent objects
- ### Builder
	- Separates constructing an object form the object itself
	- Means that a different object is responsible for the construction of other object
	- Helps with flexibility  
- ### Prototype 
	- Create an object by cloning an existing concrete object
	- Flexibility of creating object dynamically
	- Prototype is an instance than a type
- ### Singleton
	- Most used and the most dangerous
	- Instad of any number of objects there is only one
	- Concurrent access and lack of clarity make it dangerous 
## Structural Pattern Overview
-	### Adapter
	-	Convert from one interface to another
	-	Can be used at class level adapting typer or at the object level
	-	Data mapper are common uses
- ### Bridge
	- Independently changed an abstraction and its concrete implementetion
	- It allows for a future state where an abstract class can use an implementation that is decoupled from it
	- Allows to compose objects without adding inheritance
- ### Compositve
	- Lets you treat a set of objects in the same way that a single object is treated
	-  MVC uses Composite pattern
- ### Decorator
	-  Extends additional functionality to an object without necessarily affecting other objects of the same type
	-  Doesn't require subclassing
- ### Facade
	- Create an interface for a specific purpose
	- Makes a complex interface simpler by reducing it in some way
	- Simplify a single interface, or group a set of interfaces together
	- Several more complicate interfaces can be combined into a facade
- ### Flyweight
	- Create a representational versions of an object
	- Save memory by keeping fewer physical copies 
	- It can store its own data and is a way to access some external data as its own
- ### Proxy
	- Is a gateway object to control access to another object or source
	- Concurrency check 
	- It provides a placeholder for another object and controls access to it
	- Permission check on wrapping data access
## Behavioral Pattern Overview 
- ### Interpreter
	- A Context-specific language
	- Compose sentences that can be interpreted
- ### Template 
	- Crate places where subclasses can plug in part of an algorithm 
- ### Chain of responsibility
	- Allow any number of object in an order to handle the request until handling is completed
- ### Command
	- Encapsulate an action as its own object
	- By thinking of a business level action as an object in its own  right
- ### Iterator
	- WalkThorugh a set of like object without neeeding to know what type they are
- ### Visitor
	- Is an operation that happens on each element of a set 
	- Adds an operation to an object without altering the object
- ### Mediator
	- Encapsulates how a given set of objects interacts with one another 
	- The objects don't have to know anything about the other and only know about the mediator
	- Reduces class coupling
- ### Memento
	- Is an object that allows another object to go back to the way it was
	- It helps in storing state for an object 
	- Serialization helps to fill this role
- ### Observer
	- 1 to n relationships
	- Objects can subscribe to something and be notified when it changes
	- It allows decoupling from the observer group from the observed one 
- ### State	
	- Separete states of an object from the object itself
	- An object using this pattern doesn't need to be altered when new states are added. The states themselves are defined and can change independently of the object
- ### Strategy
	- By grouping algorithms into a similarly typed object, it is posiible to switch out the action taken on an object dynamically
