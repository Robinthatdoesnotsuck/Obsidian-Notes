## Review of Terms
### SOLID
- #### S
	- Single responsibility: a class has a single responsibility
- #### O
	- Open/closed: code is open for extension and closed for changes
- #### L
	- Liskov substitution: objects are replaceable with their subtypes
- #### I
	- Interface segregation: interfaces should be single purpose   
- #### D
	- Dependency inversion: code depends on an interface rather than on a class 
### DRY
- Don't repeat yourself
### YAGNI
- You Ain't Gonna Need It
## OOP
### Encapsulation 
- Keep information as local as possible
- Minimal Intefrace
### Abstraction
- Layers of understanding
- I don't need to write machine code for a webapp
- Smart encapsulation enables abstraction
- Ignore details that don't matter
- Avoiding good abstraction and encapsulation makes for brittle code that is hard to change and easy to break
### Inheritance 
- I can extend existing code without changing it
- Understand where code is extensible
- Inheritance means that i can create something new with the starting point of something that already exist without changing it
- Building on what is there; start from more than zero
- Helps in reusing code without breaking code that is dependant on it
### Polymorphism
- Extended objects can be treated as the thing they are extending
- Follow-up of inheritance
- Subclasses can be treated as its parent-class
## No nos
- ### Procedural programming
	- Scripting
	- List of instructions
	- Execute instructions in an order
- ### Functional programming
	- Actions over objects
	- Inmmutability
	- Different design patterns
- ### Pretend OOP
	- Just because you create an utility class is not OOP
	- It needs to follow the principles of OOP
## OOP  and Design Patterns
- ### OOP
	- OOP is a high-level abstraction/design pattern
	- Without its basis the design patterns won't work
	- It helps use in providing maintainability and reusability
- ### C#
	-  Is not purely OOP
	-  OO at the core, with procedural and functional capabilities
	-  Built with the .NET Framework that uses many design patterns
	-  A lot of value types are not objects
	-  Many common core of design patterns are already built on C#
## What are design patterns?
- A reusable solution framework to recurring problems, a way to understand recurring problems and the types of solutions effective for that problem
- Helps us building software but also helps us in making it more understandable and more maintainable over time
- Way to understand recurring problems and the types of solutions effective for that problem
- ### Pattern Languages
	- How a pattern is described and shared
		- Name
		- Motivation
		- Applicability
		- Structure diagram
		- Participating classes
		- Consequences
		- Examples
	- Are organized and ordered for consumption
	- Are a way to communicate ideas about software design 
- Patterns are a Guide
- They are just tools
## Why do we need design patterns
- Know why you are making a choice
- Cause a problem maybe different from anything but it can have similiarities to different types of problems
## History of design patterns
- We stole them from architects
- The first wiki was made to share software design patterns
- Manny patterns are part of the language design, like C# this adds functionalities to the languages
## Categories of design patterns
- ### By purpose
	- #### Creational
		- How and when objects are created
		- How the object is deferred to a subclass
		- How an interface is passed in
			- Factory Method
			- Abstract Factory
			- Builder
			- Prototype
			- Singleton
	- #### Structural
		- How classes and objects relate
			- Adapter
			- Bridge
			- Composite
			- Flyweight
			- Decorator
			-  Facade
			-  Proxy
	- #### Behavioral 
		-  How interactions are handled between classes or objects
			-  Who is responsible for what?
			-  Interpreter
			-  Template Method
			-  Chain of Responsibility
			-  Command
			-  Iterator
			-  Mediator Memento
			-  Observer
			-  State
			-  Strategy
			-  Visitor
	- #### Concurrency
		- Handling Concurrent Actions
- ### By Scope
	- Class
		- Operates at the type and class-level relationships between classes and sub-classes
	- Object
		- Deals with the relationships and structures between instantiated objects 
- Patterns are related to themselves
	- Like MVC 
	- That is a combination of different patters
	- View uses a composite pattern
	- Controller is a factory
